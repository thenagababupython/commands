Storage Services:-



we can access aws services by the following ways
1.console:- ID & Password
2.CLI:- access Key & Secret Access key
3.API:-secret key& secret access key


EBS-elastic block store -EC2
Instance store -EC2

Simple storage service (s3)-Object storage(Ex.google drive)
Elastic file system (EFS)
Glacier (Archiving)
S3:-
~Here we can create buckets to store data in S3.
~we can give primary polices by using access control and to give advanced level policies we use bucket policies or policy generators are used.

Versioning:-if we enable this every edit save as a version
replication:-we can replicate a bucket data from one region to another region.
events:-we get alerts(sms,mails) when we put or get objects to s3 bucket
life cycle:-we can create a life cycle to store data in standard or infrequent access or glacier

Glacier:-
~we can create vaults here like buckets in s3.
~we can not directly upload data to glacier like s3
~we can transfer data to glacier  from s3 by using life cycle policies or by using third party tools like fast glacier

ELASTIC FILE SYSTEM(EFS)
          OR 
NETWORK FILE SYSTEM(NFS):-
~NFS PORT NO-2049
~Create an elastic file sysytem
~launch an instance and connect it and create two folders
#mkdir folder1
#mkdir folder2
~use mount cmd in one folder and create some files in that folder
~check the same files will appear in folder2 also.

STORAGE GATEWAY:-It is used to transfer on premises data to cloud (s3 or glacier)
~Three types 1.file gateway
             2.volume gateway
             3.tape gateway
~create a storage gateway and select file gateway and host as VMware download image
